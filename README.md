# hello-world
This is a test.
I need to get better at using Github.
I especially want to figure out how to integrate a branch.
This change will be made to Branch1.
Actually I think I merged the above change to main.  I want to keep this line separate - only on B1.
OK. That change stays on the branch, doesn't merge with the Main, unless I create a Pull Request.
So, I commit, then push the change to the Branch.
I don't do a Pull Request until I want it merge with the Main.
